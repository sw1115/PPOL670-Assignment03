This is a test R markdown document for extra credit homework:)

The graph below shows the annual sales of electric vehicles from 2011 - 2015 in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

```{r load-packages, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r read-data, include=FALSE}
evsales <- read.csv("data/evsales.csv")
```

```{r simple-plot, echo = FALSE}
evsales %>%
  filter(State == "NY" | State == "PA" | State == "MD" | State == "VA") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Year, y = sales_BEVPHEV, fill = Year)) + 
  geom_col() +
  ggtitle("EV sales by States, 2011 - 2015") + 
  scale_y_continuous("Sales of Electric Vehicles") +
  facet_wrap(~StateName)
```
